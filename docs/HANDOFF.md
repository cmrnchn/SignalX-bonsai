# SignalX - Handoff

## Where things stand

- **Working today:** Tauri + React GUI over a Rust Signal daemon (`signal-cli`),
  local thread persistence, outbox worker, optional Ollama drafts and guarded
  auto-reply, local commerce (catalog / customers / quotes / orders / IVR /
  Sales).
- **Identity:** one *live* Signal account at a time. A PIN-gated roster can hold
  multiple numbers; switching stops receive/outbox for the previous identity.
  Commerce, IVR, and auto-reply are stored under `accounts/{id}/`.
- **Send path:** all outbound messages go through the outbox.
- **Next:** see long-term backlog in `docs/NEXT_STEPS.md` (inbound media,
  unified Audit, keyboard shortcuts, backup v2, etc.). Commerce-depth phases
  1–4 are shipped. `docs/CURSOR_TASKS.md` has four of these scoped into
  ready-to-implement tasks with exact file/line citations.

## Run it

```bash
cp .signalx.env.example .signalx.env   # edit number + signal-cli config path
npm install
npm run tauri dev
# or: ./run-dev.sh / ./SignalX-Dev.command

# headless (optional):
cd src-tauri && cargo run -- --headless
SIGNALX_AGENT=1 cargo run -- --headless   # AI drafts on inbound
```

Config keys: `SIGNALX_SIGNALCLI_CONFIG`, `SIGNALX_NUMBER`, optional
`SIGNALX_SIGNALCLI_BIN`, `SIGNALX_OLLAMA_*`. Never commit `.signalx.env`.

## Conventions

1. Daemon is source of truth for messages — no localStorage canonical state.
2. Event-driven UI updates via `AppHandle.emit`.
3. Commands return `{success: true, data}` or `{success: false, error}`.
4. AI never auto-sends in assisted mode; auto-reply is separate, opt-in, guarded.
5. Draft quotes do not decrement stock; Confirm does (once). IVR place-order stays confirmed.
6. One live Signal identity: roster unlock is PIN-gated; never two outboxes.
